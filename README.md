👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a Competitive Programmer and Generative AI enthusiast who builds intelligent, scalable applications from the ground up. My foundation in algorithms (LeetCode Knight) is the launchpad for my work in AI.

Here's a quick summary of what I do:

🤖 Generative AI Development: I specialize in engineering end-to-end RAG pipelines using LangChain, ChromaDB, and Google's Gemini API, as demonstrated in my KnowledgeAI project.

🚀 Machine Learning & Full-Stack: I have hands-on experience building and deploying recommendation systems (FlickNest) and leveraging cloud tools like AWS and Firebase.

👨‍🏫 Community Leadership: As the Competitive Programming Lead for the Google Developer Group, I enjoy mentoring peers and fostering a passion for problem-solving.

🚀 More About Me
🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing my KnowledgeAI project with more advanced RAG techniques.

🌱 I’m currently learning about scalable LLM deployment strategies on AWS.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Generative AI projects.

💬 Ask me about Python, LangChain, RAG pipelines, and competitive programming strategies.
